# Go SDK for Nitric

The Go SDK supports the use of the Nitric framework with GoLang 1.16. For more information, check out the main [Nitric repo](https://github.com/nitrictech/nitric).

Nitric SDKs provide an infrastructure-as-code style that lets you define resources in code. You can also write the functions that support the logic behind APIs, subscribers and schedules.

You can request the type of access you need to resources such as publishing for topics, without dealing directly with IAM or policy documents.

## Status

The SDK is in early stage development and APIs and interfaces are still subject to breaking changes. Weâ€™d love your feedback as we build additional functionality!
